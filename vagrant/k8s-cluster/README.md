# requirements
```
vagrant
virtualbox
```

# Fire up vms

``` 
bash createCluster.sh
```

The script will do 3 things:

1. create masters and configure network using an addon like Antrea
2. create workers and make them join the master
3. do additional configuration like creating an ingress controller

# Accessing machines

To access each machine respectively via 

```
vagrant ssh master
vagrant ssh worker-1
```
